# Time To Eat!

## An application to Help you Meal Prep

TimeToEat will help you plan your meals by:
- **Keeping Track** of the items you have in your pantry
- **Providing** meal ideas for the time you have with the ingredients you have!
- **Inform** you of the groceries you need to purchase for meals on your meal-list

*This application cannot create new recipes but 
instead extracts them from a set of recipes you have already implemented*

This application will use a set of recipes that the user has implemented
and propose possible meal ideas for different time-slots available to the user
and different ingredients available to the user. It is ideally
catered towards the university/college student age-range, aiming to improve
the eating habits of students experiencing new life on campus.

This project is of interest to me as it is something that I personally struggled with
throughout my first semester (and even now) to properly plan out my meals with the appropriate time
I had.
